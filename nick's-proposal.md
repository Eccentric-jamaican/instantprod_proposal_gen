Scaling X to $Y/mo
===================

With the context from our recent project, X could be a >$Y/mo business with a few minor changes.

Some reasons why:

- Your service is undoubtedly high quality. Most of your clients see success and a sizable ROI from their investment with you.
- You understand your market well. You know how to talk to your customers, the language they use, and the things they find important.
- You genuinely care about your team and are invested in their success. You probably feel remorse at the idea of having to make restructuring decisions, or move people around.
- Like many founders, you are charismatic, intelligent, and—unfortunately—the bottleneck in your business. Further growth may necessitate a shift in how you operate, which is worth bringing to your attention.

With that out of the way, this proposal will first outline your goals, then the problems X is suffering from that are getting in the way of those goals, then solutions to each problem, and finally how to implement them.

## Your goals

Here is what you likely want (that you have yet to fully achieve) from X:

- $X/month or more in monthly revenue.
- A strong source of personal income (perhaps $400K+/year).
- More freedom and flexibility, like the ability to take time off without worrying about your business collapsing, plus 8 hours of sleep at night and more time with your family.
- The privilege to be more selective about which clients/people you allocate your time towards.
- The ability to architect longer-term initiatives and projects without having your attention pulled away every hour to mundane or repetitive tasks.
- Complete trust in your team to deliver a high-quality product that matches the quality you would deliver personally, instead of having to run behind them or clean up their mess.
- The opportunity to provide your staff with work they are passionate about, a sense of community, and plentiful growth opportunities.
- To operate as a company—not “you + 5 helpers”—that accrues enterprise value and lets you reap the rewards of both consistent income and a lump sum if/when you decide to sell.
- [More goals—all of these are just examples.]

These goals are based on our discussions and chats, and can be refined as needed.

## Problem factors

One of your goals is $X/month, but the way X is currently set up is preventing you from achieving that.

Some key factors:

- A lack of structured management practices at your team is currently costing you $X/month. Your staff members are worth $X/hour, and right now… [explanation].
- Hesitance to restructure is costing you $X/month. After looking at current output of the X department, it appears that… [explanation].
- Misallocation of your own time is costing you $X/month. Here’s why… [explanation].
- [Insert other problem factors and explanations here.]

By not addressing these, you are collectively spending [direct expense] in direct expenses and somewhere in the range of [opportunity cost] in opportunity cost (the money you could be making if resources were allocated differently).

If nothing changes, your bandwidth will likely continue to be bottlenecked by new clients, random fires, and mundane requests. You’ll spend more time on the business, working later and longer, with fewer hours on important tasks and more on mundane tasks—leading to less enjoyment, less revenue, less time with your family, and potentially burnout.

## Proposed solutions

These phases prioritize increasing growth by X%, improving margins by X%, and freeing your time to focus on high-ROI activities. You are currently spending the vast majority of your day on $X/hr tasks when your real value should be closer to $X/hr.

This is what working together could look like.

### Implement structured management practices

#### Timeframe: first week → first month

Specifically, the plan would be to:

1. Have a brief conversation with the team about what is changing and why. For example: “We’re starting a daily standup practice to eliminate blockers. This involves X & Y and begins at 9:05am, so you have to be here by then. Let’s have our first one now.”
2. Begin standups by EOW, run them for one month, and gauge progress.
3. After one month, assuming progress goes well, implement weekly 1:1s where the team can talk in private to bring up concerns, suggestions, and performance.
4. Build an in-depth standup structure based on a proven playbook that companies are using to make $X/month.

[Continue this format for each other deliverable.]

## My pitch

Working with your company has been enjoyable, and there is a strong desire to see it succeed far past its current level. $X/mo is likely on the lower end of what is possible.

The goal is to become your [role] and achieve [goals] together.

If you accept, the plan is to solve your operational issues and partner with you to scale this into a semi-autonomous machine that makes at least $X/yr. You would gain an operations professional dedicated to your business, with technical skills that complement your competence and reputation.

## Terms

Here are the proposed terms:

- Preference for some “skin in the game”.
- Instead of a sizable flat fee, compensation would be a lower base plus a percentage of revenue.
- This aligns incentives; when you grow, the compensation grows.
- The structure is designed so you do not feel like this is a disproportionate risk, given the confidence in what can be achieved together.

### Compensation

- $10,000 base paid on the first day of the month.
- 7% of revenue paid on the last day of the month.
- For example, if in September 2025 X bills $100,000, the payment would be $10,000 + $7,000 = $17,000.
- If in November 2023 X bills $150,000, the payment would be $10,000 + $10,500 = $20,500.
- This is intended as fair compensation that scales with the value brought to you and X.

## In closing

X can likely be at least X times its current size with its great team, a few tweaks, and the right partner. You have a unique opportunity ahead and this proposal is an invitation to collaborate on it.

If this is a fit, you can accept by paying the associated invoice. If not, you are welcome to still use the structure and ideas above; the intention is genuinely to see you and X succeed.
