              <p className="text-white/70">How to contact us: <a className="underline" href="mailto:support@instantprod.dev">support@instantprod.dev</a></p>
              <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, share, and protect personal data in connection with our website and Services. It works together with our Terms &amp; Conditions.</p>

            <h2>1) Roles &amp; Scope</h2>
            <p>
              When we run our own website, billing, sales, and support, we act as a data controller.
              <br />
              When we manage a client website or process leads on your behalf (e.g., routing form submissions into your CRM), we act as your data processor and will sign a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) on request.
              <br />
              This Policy covers: instantprod.dev, client onboarding forms, and our delivery workflow tools (e.g., Trello). It does not cover third-party sites we don’t control; review those providers’ policies separately.
            </p>

            <h2>6) Sharing Your Data</h2>
            <p>
              We share personal data only with:
              <br />
              Service providers / processors that help us run Instantprod (e.g., Stripe for payments; Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare for hosting; GitHub; Trello; email/CRM tools; analytics).

            </p>

            <h2>7) International Transfers</h2>
            <p>
              We may store or process data outside Jamaica (e.g., the USA/EU). When we transfer personal data internationally, we use appropriate safeguards (such as Standard Contractual Clauses or equivalent contractual protections).
            </p>

            <h2>8) Data Retention</h2>
            <p>
              We keep data only as long as needed for the purposes in this Policy, to perform a contract, or to meet legal obligations.
              <br />
              Operational logs/analytics are kept for a limited period and then aggregated or deleted.
              <br />
              You can ask us to delete data we control, subject to legal/operational exceptions.
            </p>

            <h2>9) Security</h2>
            <p>
              We use reasonable technical and organizational measures: least-privilege access, encrypted transport, access reviews, and recommended two-factor authentication for shared tools. No method is 100% secure; we can’t guarantee absolute security.
            </p>

            <h2>10) Your Rights</h2>
            <p>

              <br />
              Rectify inaccurate or incomplete data

              <br />
              Restrict or object to certain processing
              <br />
              Portability (receive your data in a usable format)
              <br />
              Withdraw consent where processing relies on consent
            </p>
